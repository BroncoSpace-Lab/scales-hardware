Important note: It is ideal to be using a 64-bit Linux host machine as opposed to Windows or a virtual machine. ARM Cortec Linux machine will not work (cannot use a Jetson as host computer for development). 

# Connecting directly to the i.MX 8X:

Connect to the dev board following the [Quick Start guide](https://docs.phytec.com/projects/yocto-phycore-imx8x/en/latest/quickstart/index.html#basic-evaluation-requirements). 

### Required materials: 

- i.MX 8X development board, with microUSB UART cable and power cable. 
- A Windows computer with Tera Term installed (or other serial communication software.) 

### Directions
1. Do not power the board yet. Connect the UART debug cable to X51 UART0 on the board, and the USB part into your computer. 

    - There are two serial ports that are specific to the i.MX 8X. One will be the debug terminal, and the other will be the main command terminal. Each different Windows host computer will have different names for these ports, so in the next few steps the ports COM15 and COM16 are example ports from Kelly’s computer. 
    - It is a good idea to open both serial ports that appear as options in Tera Term during your first setup, so that you know which ports are which for your specific computer. 

2. Start Tera Term (Windows computer). Select Serial COM15. Go to Setup > Serial Port. Change the speed to 115200. Press OK. 

    - COM15 is the command terminal. To see the debug terminal, follow the same steps for COM16. 
    - COM15 and 16 may be different on other computers. To be safe, set up both ports on the first boot to your device. 
    - Make sure to set them up before powering the board, or you will miss the sign in prompt. 

3. Plug in the DC power cable to power on the board. 

4. Sign in when prompted. Password is “root”. 


# Setting up Host Computer: 

Following [this guide to install the SDK](https://docs.phytec.com/projects/yocto-phycore-imx8x/en/latest/applicationdevelopment/InstallTheSDK.html) on the host computer. 

### Required materials: 

- 64-bit Linux host machine. 

### Directions:
1. Once the SDK is set up on the host computer, it never needs to be done again. 

2. Be sure to source the environment before doing any work on the host computer: 

    `source /opt/fsl-imx-xwayland/5.4-zeus/environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux`

# Setting up Ethernet: 

### Required materials: 

- Windows computer with Tera Term installed 
- Ethernet cable 
- Router/Ethernet hub 
- i.MX 8X development board 

### Directions:

1. Connect an ethernet cable from the router to an ethernet hub. Then connect another ethernet cable from your computer to the hub, and a third cable from the board to the hub. 

2. Test internet connection on the board. 

    `ping 8.8.8.8`

    `ping google.com` (may not work) 

3. Find the IP address of the board in Tera Term 

    ifconfig 

    - The IP will be following the words “inet addr” under the ethernet port number you connected to. 
    - The following image shows the IP is 192.168.0.190 for eth0 
    - This may change each time you boot the board, so be sure to check.

4. Run VS Code and open a WSL terminal 

    - Good practice is to run the following: 

    `sudo apt-get update` 

5. Use `sudo apt-get install ssh` to update ssh if needed. 

6. Command to ssh into board: (make sure to update the IP) 

    `ssh root@192.168.0.145 -o HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -o PubKeyAcceptedAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa`

7. Congrats you are now in the board on your computer. 

# I2C Interfacing: 

Following [this guide on I2C interfacing](https://docs.phytec.com/projects/yocto-phycore-imx8x/en/latest/interfaceguides/i2c.html). 

### Required materials: 

- MPC9808 Temp. Sensor with 4 female to female dupont wires 
- i.MX 8X development board 
- Windows computer with Tera Term installed 
- 64-bit Linux host computer 

#### Hardware Setup: 

Wire Legend: 

    red - Vdd		black - Gnd		brown - SCL		blue - SDA 

![i2c sensor setup](Images/i2c_sensor_setup.png)

    red goes into pin 1 of X60. 

### Directions:
1. Follow instructions for setting up ethernet. The following commands can be done either in Tera Term on a Windows machine connected to the board or in terminal ssh’d into the board from the Linux host computer. 

2. List the available I2C devices 

    `ls /dev/i2c*`

3. Scan the board for devices 

    `i2cdetect -y -r 16`

4. Default output: (time to play spot the difference to find your device’s address) 

![i2cdetect expected output](Images/expected_i2cdetect_output.png)

Expected Output

![i2cdetect output with sensor](Images/my_i2cdetect_output.png)

my output (device address is 0x18) 

5. In the host computer’s terminal, source the correct cross-compiler for C code: 

    `source /opt/fsl-imx-xwayland/5.4-zeus/environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux`

6. Enter the C compiler directory: 

    `cd /opt/fsl-imx-xwayland/5.4-zeus/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-poky-linux`

7. Run the code for the sensor: 

    `sudo ./aarch64-poky-linux-gcc -mcpu=cortex-a35+crc+crypto -fstack-protector-strong -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -Wformat -Wformat-security -Werror=format-security --sysroot=/opt/fsl-imx-xwayland/5.4-zeus/sysroots/aarch64-poky-linux -O ~/imx8x/i2c-temp-sensor/MCP9808.c -o ~/imx8x/i2c-temp-sensor/mcp9808a` 

- Note: this path only works for C code. If you want to use C++, change the gcc at the beginning to g++. I am still trying to figure out how to do python code so stay tuned for that. 

- Note: This code is from GitHub. It was listed as free to use, distributed with a free-will license (mentioned in first line of code comments). 

8. This code will generate an executable file. There are two options for running this code on the board: 

 **USB:**

1. Copy the file to a USB and insert it in the board. Run the following commands on the board to set up the USB: 

    `echo host > /sys/kernel/debug/ci_hdrc.0/role `

    `cd /sys/class/gpio/ `

    `echo 30 > export `

    `echo out > gpio30/direction `

    `echo 0 > gpio30/value `

2. Check to make sure the sda1 is accessible by running: 

    `ls /run/media/ `

3. Run the code for the sensor by running: 

    `cd /run/media/sda1 `

    `./mcp9808a`

4. You should see the temperature readings in the terminal. 

 **GitHub:**

1. The board must be connected to internet via wifi or ethernet for this method to work. 

2. On the board navigate to the scales-hardware directory (this is a clone of our GitHub repo.) and update the repo 

    `cd scales-hardware `

    `git add . `

    `git pull `

4. Then navigate to the imx8x folder and (optionally) view the files there. 

    `cd imx8x `

    `ls `

5. And run the code for the sensor in the same way as before: 

    `./mcp9808a `

6. You should see the temperature sensor readings in the terminal
