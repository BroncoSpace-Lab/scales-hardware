# Power System Development
## Requirements:
-Supply Power to Sub-components on SCALES Carrier Board
   - Components to be used are still being finalized, but they are based on the following [SCALES Component Selection List] (https://livecsupomona.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/broncospacelab/Shared%20Documents/SCALES%20-%20General/Documentation/Hardware/SCALES%20Hardware%20Component%20Selection.xlsx?d=w0a79ca0a7f3241a1b204a2bc7466c9c3&csf=1&web=1&e=7n6GZM) which are based on the existing Notion documentation and trade studies used for PDR.

## To do:
    (1/28/25)
    - Figure out each of the maximum power requirements for each of the components on the [SCALES Component Selection List] (https://livecsupomona.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/broncospacelab/Shared%20Documents/SCALES%20-%20General/Documentation/Hardware/SCALES%20Hardware%20Component%20Selection.xlsx?d=w0a79ca0a7f3241a1b204a2bc7466c9c3&csf=1&web=1&e=7n6GZM) 
    - Start looking into how power distribution systems work for different power levels, Phyllis said she would help sending some resources to start looking into it.
