# SCALES Power Distribution System Development

## Requirements:
-Supply Power to Sub-components on SCALES Carrier Board
   - Components to be used are still being finalized, but they are based on the following [SCALES Component Selection List](https://livecsupomona.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/broncospacelab/Shared%20Documents/SCALES%20-%20General/Documentation/Hardware/SCALES%20Hardware%20Component%20Selection.xlsx?d=w0a79ca0a7f3241a1b204a2bc7466c9c3&csf=1&web=1&e=7n6GZM)
     * Supply power levels to the following:
         * Flight Computer: IMX8/VOXL2
         * Edge Computer: Nvidia Jetson AGR ORIN
         * FPGA System: AMD Artix 7 XC7A200T
   - Standardize Voltage Input:
         * 28V/24V/22V

## Research Notes:
(1/28/25)
- Figure out each of the maximum power requirements for each of the components
- Start looking into how power distribution systems work for different power levels
