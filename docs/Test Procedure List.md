### 2. Power Testing

> <ins>Objective:</ins> We will be observing different power states of both flight computers (high, middle, low, overclocked, underclocked, idle) to obtain a better understanding of how much power each flight computer will generally use. To do this, we will be using cpuburn to activate different percentages(100%, 50%, and 10%) of the cpu's cores and the power consumption at each percentage. For over and under clocking, we will manually set the clockspeed of the cpu to (clockspeed-0.4GHz) for underclocking and (clockspeed+0.2GHz) for overclocking. For the idle state, we will turn flight computer on with no tasks running and observe power consumption.

## First System Level Test (FC and Jetson Only)
### 1. FC to Jetson Watchdog Timer Test

> <ins>Objective:</ins> We will be verifying that the FC is able to act as the Jetson's watchdog timer. This will be done by connecting a GPIO pin from the FC to the Jetson, which will have the Jetson send a pulse every 5 seconds to the FC to reset a digital counter on the FC. The Jetson will also be connected to the FC through its reset pin, which allows the FC to reset the Jetson if the Jetson stops sending a pulse through the GPIO pin. This test will test the case when the Jetson stops sending a pulse, which will force the FC to reset the Jetson.

 <ins>Test Equipment:</ins>
 
 - Flight computer (IMX8 dev board / VOXL2 dev board)
 - Jetson
 - variety of jumper wires

 <ins>FC and Jetson Scripts: (need to be developed)</ins>
 
 - The FC will have a script that will have a counter. One the counter reaches 5 seconds, it will pull the reset button on the Jetson high to reset the Jetson. This counter will reset to zero when the FC recieves a pulse from the GPIO pin from the Jetson.
 - The Jetson will have a script that will send a pulse through the GPIO pin every 4 seconds.
