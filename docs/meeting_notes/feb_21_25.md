## Andrew Greenberg Feb 21 2025 Notes
During this technical exchange call with Andrew Greenberg we discussed Luca's Power Circuit and the use of SatCat5 in the SCALES system.

- There needs to be a power input spec! Right now the design is arbitrary without it
- When the power regulator goes nuts do you want it connected to the load switch or to the 28V input? 
- If the put the load switch first, you have the chance to protect your input voltage from a downstream voltage regulator
- It would be possible to derate the voltage regulators a bit if we use some kind of soft start capability on the Jetson
- We need to know three things: 
    - Idle Current
    - Max Operational Average Current
    - Max Transient Current
- A Watchdog failure’s fault tree can lead to loss of mission
    - Taking away that fault tree is better than maybe bringing in slightly more reliability
- Using idealized schematic symbols rather than a package symbol in the schematic is generally better
- Point the grounds down and the voltage sources up!
- Separate sheet for each voltage regulator is a good idea!
- It’s probably better to just switch to a load switch with integrated over current protection rather than relying on the power monitor to go into software (software people will leave you out to dry)
- For under-voltage we need to circle back to the question of what that means for the input
- We should make sure to power up in non-clock mode and then sync at a later time rather than having to immediately sync
    - This is really for noise shaping (so you can control where your EMI is)
- With regards to slew rates: we need to determine what happens if the clock crystals go crazy and lock up the regulators
    - The regulators should fall back to RT if the clock lock up (TEST THIS)
    - You can mess with this using an eval board
- Tantalum caps have a high inductance in series (this is why you mix big and small capacitors)
- Generate the reset timing with an automotive Schmitt Trigger with an RC clock

No notes were taken, but we decided to descope SatCat5 from the SCALES system due to the likelihood that it becomes an engineering quagmire.
