## Requirements:
Supply Power to sub-components on SCALES Carrier Board

## Components to be used:
Components to be used are still being finalized, but they are based on the following [SCALES Component Selection List](https://livecsupomona.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/broncospacelab/Shared%20Documents/SCALES%20-%20General/Documentation/Hardware/SCALES%20Hardware%20Component%20Selection.xlsx?d=w0a79ca0a7f3241a1b204a2bc7466c9c3&csf=1&web=1&e=7n6GZM).
- **Flight Computer: IMX8/VOXL2**
  - **IMX8:** 
      - 3.3V / 2A (Inrush Max) - Power (Max) = 3.63W *(based on datasheet)*
  - **VOXL2:** 
      - 12V / 6A (Inrush Max) - Power (Max) = 7W *(based on Janelle's testing; check datasheet for idle values)*

- **Edge Computer: Nvidia Jetson AGX OrWin**
  - End-user must have access to peak power, so they can switch between performance modes.
  - **AGR Orin:** 
      - 20V / 3.75A (MAX) - Power (Max) = 75W *(based on max current/voltage ratings)*

- **FPGA System:**
    **AMD Artix 7 XC7A200T SOM**
      - 5V / 2A (MAX) - Power (Max) = 10W *(based on datasheet and max utilization data)*

## Standardize Power Input
- **28V power supply/battery input**
  - Based on information compiled above *(Does this include system peripherals?)*:
    - **OBC:** 3.3V @ 2A Max (IMX8) / 12V @ 6A Max (VOXL2)
    - **EC:** 20V @ 3.75A Max (Jetson AGX)
    - **FPGA:** 5V @ 2A Max (Artix 7 SOM)

- [Basic Block Diagram of EPS board for SCALES Components](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f2GgWEEMVI20wVgbpNZj8v8eEYCyvHen/view?usp=sharing)
   - Requirements: (Using Janelles Power Board Block Diagram for reference)
      - Microcontroller (Ex: STM32F091)
         - Checks Watchdog Timer
         - Measures current and voltage outputs
         - Utilizes CAN/I2C to relay current/voltage info to OBC
      - External Voltage in connector
         - start thinking about types of connectors that can handle high current input @ 24/28V inputs that are standard in aerospace/cubesat applications
      - Analog to Digital converters 
         - Used to measure voltage/current values and translate them to GPIO inputs for the MCU
      - Voltage Channel Buck Converters/Switching regulators
      - RBF System
         - Use relay to bypass high current/ MOSFET/FET?
      - Temperature Sensors for Buck/Switching Regulators

### (2/3/25)
- 1st Block Diagram:
 ![EPSBlock_V1](images/EPS_BlockV1.png)
   - Comments from Zach: 
      No need for MCU, Watchdog takes care of system stability based on timing pings
      Watchdog should be powered straight from the 28v stepped down to 5v/3v3
      Does Each voltage line needs to have voltage/current sensors? This is because it may be completely redundant, theres no point in adding a sensor that depends on the OBC to be running and even if what would it be doing?
      Stick to a simple design, we need to make sure the watchdog can operate independently from the 3 subsystems, just needs a switching regulator to function, then the pinged input from the OBC will stop the system from resetting.
      Because the watchdog will be what triggers the power cycle, we need to add some sort of system relay that triggers if a ping is not recieved.

- 2nd Block Diagram:
![EPSBlock_V2](images/EPS_BlockV2.png)
- Requirements: (More simple design, almost purely analog)
      - 28V V+/GND Connector
      - Relay/Switch system to be triggered by Watchdog (Normally Closed, Watchdog RST command triggers Open Switch)
      - Switching Regulators
         - 28v -> 20v (up to 8A) (Jetson)
         - 28v -> 24v/22v (Watchdog)
         - 28V -> 12v (OBC VOXL2/IMX8)
         - 28v -> 5v (FPGA Artix 7)
      - [Watchdog System](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/61564344/374731107-10ac20a2-ea8e-4982-9281-9fe7444e7854.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3Mzg2MTExOTksIm5iZiI6MTczODYxMDg5OSwicGF0aCI6Ii82MTU2NDM0NC8zNzQ3MzExMDctMTBhYzIwYTItZWE4ZS00OTgyLTkyODEtOWZlNzQ0NGU3ODU0LnBuZz9YLUFtei1BbGdvcml0aG09QVdTNC1ITUFDLVNIQTI1NiZYLUFtei1DcmVkZW50aWFsPUFLSUFWQ09EWUxTQTUzUFFLNFpBJTJGMjAyNTAyMDMlMkZ1cy1lYXN0LTElMkZzMyUyRmF3czRfcmVxdWVzdCZYLUFtei1EYXRlPTIwMjUwMjAzVDE5MjgxOVomWC1BbXotRXhwaXJlcz0zMDAmWC1BbXotU2lnbmF0dXJlPTg3ZjEyZDBmOTkwYWZhOTM1N2NhZjU4NmU1ZmFkOTNkODBkMDVmYjcwODc0MjhlMjZlYTAxMWM5NjRiMzk3M2MmWC1BbXotU2lnbmVkSGVhZGVycz1ob3N0In0.Eo-wQk_yyZsGSnr17a3k5jSkEDWWzKaskMTcdA0J3aw)
         - Based on the TLV1704-SEP (Voltage input rated up to 24v)
         - No idea how it works but its what we will be using, schematic is complicated, linked above

   - Comments from Zach: Simple, makes sense
   - Comments from Michael:
        - Watchdog system for each logic system, to trigger each individual line rather than the whole system
        - To trigger the reset, dont use relays, find some sort of solid state system 
        - Power sequencing to turn on each section individually, inrush current will be too high if we turn them on all at once
         - delay timer to sequence each section

      - **Common Components in Power Boards**
      This list of components for the power board is based on information gathered from the various power systems above
         - *MCU*:
            - Power regulation monitoring
               - voltage and current measuring
            - Fault detection and protection
               - protects against shorts, overcurrent, brownouts and undervolting situations
               - can send system reset commands
            - OBC communication for power telemetry
               - integrate with IMX8/VOXL2
         - *Temperature sensors*:
            - Used to monitor connector/converter temps in case of high current cases
            - Some smallsat EPS use thermistors as a way to easily measure temperature, may be innacurate, or simple enough
         - *Watchdog*:
            - sends regular intervals to main components to check that they are operating correctly, IIRC only the jetson will have this
         - *Switching Regulator/(DC/DC) Buck Converter*:
            -Steps down voltage with minimal loss to respective subsystem (Uses capacitors, inductors and transistors to step down voltages using switching frequencies)
               - 28V -> 3v3/5v/12v @high current input/output
         - *RBF Pin/Kill Switch/Reset Switch*:
            - Some
         - *Fuse*: (probably not the best to use because if it blows, the whole system is inoperable until it comes back down)
            - Last bastion of defense in case of a current surge, protecting all components from frying (not likely to be used)

### (2/3/25) - (2/10/25)
- EPS:
   - 28V Power Input
      - Connectors:
         - 
   - Load Switches [INFO](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva652a/slva652a.pdf?ts=1738793997138&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F)
      - Load switches come AFTER switch regulators
         - [Load Switch](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm7310.pdf?ts=1738872017422&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Fproduct%252FLM7310)
            - TILM73100 
            - Going with ths one for now because of the high current and voltage rating, has integrated current sensing, over and undervoltage protection, and an enable pin. Also has an analog current sensor.

   - Switching regulator [Vicor PI3740-00](https://www.vicorpower.com/documents/datasheets/ds_pi3740-00.pdf) (this is probably insanely fucking overkill, but better safe than sorry)
      - Using one for each subsystem, they are about 12 dollars each, and have very high efficiency ratings, they also have the majority of components already integrated.
         - Datasheet has recommended capacitors for specific voltage ranges as well as calculation sheet for inductor selection
      - 28v -> 5v (Watchdogs)
      - 28v -> 20v (Jetson)
      - 28v -> 12v (OBC)
      - 28v -> 5v (FPGA)
   - Voltage/Current monitor
      - [INA230](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina230.pdf?ts=1739195723292)
         -36V, Voltage and Power sensor, I2C communication
   - Watchdog(s)
      - Need 3, one for Jetson, OBC, FPGA
         - Use Proves implementation available [here](https://github.com/BroncoSpace-Lab/scales-rad-tolerant-watchdog?tab=readme-ov-file)
   - Watchdog for each voltage level instead of the full system

### (2/11/25)
- Notes on Rev A from michael:
   - Switching Regulator: Vicor PI3740 is not in stock, find another one, stick to TI or Analog devices
   - Add a GPIO pin to toggle the enable pin on each regulator, if its needed to reset power output
   - Make sure all capacitors are ceramic, electrolytic caps can explode in space
- Move to Rev B:
   - Implement the following:
      - New Switching regulator
         - Options:
            - [LT8638SEV#PBF](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Analog-Devices/LT8638SEVPBF?qs=sGAEpiMZZMsMIqGZiACxIZbomz1DP27AbMqUs%252Bj26yi9VZ8WhNpLhw%3D%3D) (2.8V to 42V 10A/12A) Both should be the same
            - Left off on implementing footprint and symbol will implement design wednesday
               - Pins:
                   - PHMODE: Tie to ground for single phase operation
                   - BIAS: Because output voltage is from 3.3v to 25v, datasheet says to tie it to Vout
                   - INTVcc: Internal 3.4V regulator bypass pin. Use a 1uf ESR capacitor from here to ground CLOSE to the ICEPS2
                     - 1uF capacitor
                   - BST: Used to provide a drive voltage, higher than the input voltage, supplies current to the topside power switch, us a 0.1uF boost capacitor
                     - 0.1uF capacitor
                   - SW: Outputs of the internal power switches. Tie them together and connect them to the inductor. For the PCB keep the nodes small and close together.
                     - Confirm inductor value
                   - GND: Place the gnd terminal of the input capacitor as close to the GND pins as possible. Try to use pins 29 and 32 for best thermal performance although they may be left disconnected.
                   - Vin: VIN pin supply current to the LT8638S internal circuitry and to the topside switch. To be tied together and be locally bypassed by a 4.7uF capacitor.
                     - 4.7uf capacitor
                     - Place the capacitor + side as close to the VIN pins, and the - side as close as possible to the GND pins
                  - EN/UV: Enable pin for the IC, you can use a voltage divider configuration from Vin to set a threshold voltage to program the IC to turn off if the voltage drops below this level. I will not be using this.
                  - RT: A resistor is tied between RT and ground to set the switching frequency
                     - Confirm switching frequency for output voltage and current
                  - CLKOUT: Output clock signal for PolyPhase Operation, in forced continuous, spread spectrum, and synchronization mode it outputs a 50% duty cycle square wave of the switching frequency. If in burst mode operation, the CLKOUT pin. If not use, let it float. I  wont be using this pin. NC
                  - Sync/Mode: Has four operating modes:
                     - Burst Mode: Tie to ground for this mode.
                     - Forced Continuous Mode, fast transient response and full frequency load over a wide load range, Float pin for this mode.
                     - Forced Continuous Mode with Spread Spectrum, allows for FCM but with a small modulation of the switching frequency to reduce EMI, if desired tie to INTVcc
                     - Synchronization Mode, drive it with a clock source to an external frequency, during the sync it will behave in forced continuous mode
                  - PG: Power good pin, remains low until the FB pin is within +-7.75% of the final regulation voltage. PG is valid when Vin is above 2.8V
                  - SS: Output tracking and a soft start pin, allows for regulation of the output voltage ramp rate. Documentation has a function that relates the input voltage to the pin to the rate at which the output voltage can increase by. I will not be using this as a load switch will take care of this. In order to disable this, set SS to higher than 1v, or may be left floating.
                  - FB: Feedback pin that sets the output voltage according to a provided formula in the data sheet
                  - Vc: Internal error amplifier, used to help stability in the output voltage, recommended by data sheet is a 10kohm resistor with a 1nF cap to ground.               
               - Jetson Config:
                  - Enable FCM:
                     - Leave Sync/Mode pin floating
                  - FB Resistor Network:
                     - Program the output voltage with a resistor divider, Jetson requires 20V.
                     - Formula: R1 = R2((Vout/.6v)-1)
                     - Calculated Values: R1 = 100kOhm, R2 = 3kOhm, Check calculations sheet to check.
                  - RT Resistor Selection:
                     - Resistor value that sets the switching frequency based on the following formula
                     - RT = (44.8/fsw) -5.9, RT is in Kohms
                     - Settled on 400Khz so RT about 105KOhms
                     - Calculations done on sheet on my ipad, will link here later
                  - Inductor Calculation and Selection:
                     - Requires about 4 different calculations including the frequency selection.
                     - Concluded with L >= 6uH with Irms >= 15A for safe operation
      - Current/Voltage Sensors
      - Standalone 5V line for peripherals
      - GPIO Enable pins for Switching regulators
      - Start calculating load switch resistors and capacitor values
