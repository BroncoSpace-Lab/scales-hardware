# First board
This folder holds the board that was first orded to JLC and then it also has an updated version that based on the notes from the JLC engineers about via and traces.

## List of changes
* Changed all the vias to be of size 0.6/0.3mm being a via diameter of 0.6mm and the hole size of 0.3mm. In doing this it required me to reroute a couple of different traces which prompted me to try and see if could change some of the trace widths.

* Modified trace widths for the Ethernet signals along with rerouting around vias. This lead to trying and moving some of the traces to different layers to ensure it still works. *This will be determined after the boards arrive and testing is complete*

* There are othere minor changes like increasing fill zone sizes, moving some resistor and LED placements that was due to vias needed to be moved or singal routing created islands.
